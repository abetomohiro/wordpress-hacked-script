See File.ext, This is empty.
Guess this is a scout file to make sure that Hacker can upload.
Oldest timestamp actually.

update-script.php seems the heart of this function but need to decode.
decoder should be bannerhawJ.php, robotsAEq.php.

I've not decode the files so much.
If someone interested, Please try and tell us what goes on.
